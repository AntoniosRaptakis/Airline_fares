The airplane has become the safest form of transport and is used by many people every day. The prices of airfares can depend on different factors like distance, connecting flights, time of day the flight is operated, class and others.



For this project, I took the dataset from kaggle, which includes flights between 7 cities in India, operated by different airlines. By selecting different options, you can explore the dataset and compare the prices.
