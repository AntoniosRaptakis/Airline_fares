The airplane has become the safest form of transport and is used by many people every day. The prices of airfares can depend on different factors like distance, connecting flights, time of day the flight is operated, class and others.

My motivation for this project was to predict the prices of the airfares. The dataset has been taken by kaggle and includes flights between 7 cities in India, operated by different airlines:

Later, I will upload the jupyter notebook where I use ML techniques in order to predict the airfares prices.

Apart from the prediction, I prepared a WebApp. By selecting different options in the WebApp, one can explore the dataset and compare the prices.

Libraries used for the WebApp:
