The airplane has become the safest form of transport and is used by many people every day. The prices of airfares can depend on different factors like distance, connecting flights, time of day the flight is operated, class and others.

My motivation for this project was to predict the prices of the airfares. The dataset has been taken by kaggle and includes flights between 7 cities in India, operated by different airlines:

## The jupyter notebook
 The jupyter notebook includes all of the data analysis and forecasting. For the predictions, I used the regression technique and time series analysis.
 
 The libraries that I used:
 
 - Numpy
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn
 - Plotly
 - Folium
 - Skicit-learn
 - Statsmodels


The dataset from kaggle was more than 50 MB and I could not upload it. In case that the notebook file is trembling, please check out the respective pdf file.



## The WebApp
Apart from the prediction, I prepared a WebApp. By selecting different options in the WebApp, one can explore the dataset and compare the prices.

The libraries that I used for the WebApp:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Folium
- Streamlit

In order to run the WebApp in the streamlit cloud, I had to use the file requirements.txt with the name of some libraries that I use in the python script.
